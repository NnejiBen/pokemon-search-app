## Pseudo-code

1. Set up Event Listener:
Listen for a click event on the search button.
Prevent the default form submission behavior.

2. Fetch Pokémon Data:
Capture the value from the search input.
Make a fetch request to the PokéAPI Proxy using the input value.

3. Handle API Response:
If the Pokémon is found, display its data (name, ID, weight, height, types, stats, and image).
If the Pokémon is not found, show an alert.

4. Update DOM Elements:
Update the respective DOM elements with the Pokémon data.
Clear previous types and stats before displaying new data.
